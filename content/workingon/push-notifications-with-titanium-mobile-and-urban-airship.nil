%p Hello again. Today I show you how to get push notifications working with Titanium Mobile.

%h3 Prerequisites

%p You need the following:

%ul
  %li An Apple Developer's Account
  %li An Account on http://urbanairship.com
  %li A Mac
  
%h3 Confusing shit - Certificates, Keys, Provision Profiles, AppIDs

%h4 Generate key

%p Just follow along.

%p On your mac open up Keychain Access. In the toolbar click 'Keychain Access' -> 'Certificate Assistant' -> 'Request a Certificate from a Certificate Authority'.

%p In the pop up window, use the email address you signed up on the Apple Developer's site with. Enter your name, and choose Save to Disk.

%p Save it somewhere you can easily find it. Keep it safe.

%h4 App IDs

%p Login into your development account, visit the iPhone Developer Program Portal, and go to the App IDs section: <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/manage/bundles/index.action">http://developer.apple.com/iphone/manage/bundles/index.action</a>

%img{:src => '/images/push_notifications/4.png'}

%p Click the New App ID button, and on the next page enter a name (MissMint) and a bundle identifier (com.spitfiresky.missmint).

%img{:src => '/images/push_notifications/5.png'}

%p After creating the AppID go to configure the id you just created. On the next page, check the box to 'Enable for Apple Push Notification service', and then click the 'Configure' button next to the Development Push SSL Certificate.

%p In the configuration window, follow the steps, and upload the CerticiateSigningRequest file we created previously using KeyChain Access.

%img{:src => '/images/push_notifications/7.png'}

%p Next download your newly generated push notification ssl certificate.

%img{:src => '/images/push_notifications/8.png'}

%p Double click on this certificate to save it your key chain. Export this key by clicking on this newly installed certificate. The exported key is saved as Certificate.p12 file on your system. Please store it other files uploaded or downloaded from portal program. This .p12 file is used in later steps for signing your Provider server.

%p Next, go back to the Apple Developer website, go to provisioning profiles, and choose to a create a new provisioning profile. <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/manage/provisioningprofiles/create.action?type=1">http://developer.apple.com/iphone/manage/provisioningprofiles/create.action?type=1</a>

%p Fill in the form with the appropriate info. 

%img{:src => '/images/push_notifications/9.png'}

%p Download the newly created provisioning profile.

%img{:src => '/images/push_notifications/10.png'}

%p Open up Titanium Mobile and open up your project. Go to Test & Package, and then the Running your app on a device section. On the 'Select Provisioning Profile' section choose to browse for the provisioning profile we just downloaded.

%img{:src => '/images/push_notifcations/11.png'}

%p Choose the provisioning profile we just downloaded.

%img{:src => '/images/push_notifcations/12.png'}

%p Open up xcode with your iphone plugged into your computer and drag the provisioning profile onto the window.

%p You might have to quit Titanium Mobile and iTunes at this point to finally get everything working. Re-open them and the in Titanium Mobile Install the app onto your phone by pressing "Install Now".

%h4 Code

%p Write the following code to alert the unique identifier id of the iphone.
