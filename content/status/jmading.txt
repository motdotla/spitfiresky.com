Note: I use the term gmail and google apps interchangeably.

*Saturday 5:00pm*
Goldmine is setup to work with Google apps on Gina's computer (I was able to access it remotely). The process is a bit involved because we have to wrap it in SSL using stunnel (Google apps requires SSL authentication but Goldmine 7 does not support SSL authentication.)

Here are the steps:

Phase 1 (stunnel configuration).

The instructions are below, but you can also watch the <a href="/videos/stunnel-phase.mov"/>phase 1 screencast</a>.

# <a href="http://www.stunnel.org/download/stunnel/win32/stunnel-4.26-installer.exe">Download stunnel to the desktop</a>
# Install the program by double clicking on it
# Once installed go to Start -> Programs -> Stunnel -> Edit stunnel.conf
# Modify as follows
## Uncomment the "client = yes" line (remove the ;  )
## modify the [pop3s] section as follows: 
### accept  = 995 
### connect = pop.gmail.com:995
## modify the [sstmp] section as follows:
### accept  = 465 
### connect = smtp.gmail.com:465
# Save that file and close it
# Click Start -> Programs -> Stunnel -> Service Install
# and Click Start -> Programs -> Stunnel -> Run Stunnel

Phase 2 (Goldmine configuration)

The instructions are tough to describe just watch the <a href="/videos/goldmine-phase.mov"/>phase 2 screencast</a>.

*Saturday 2:10pm*
Added domain aliases (securitypacific.us, buildershw.com, chasenmgmt.com). The way this works is that you can now receive email at james@securitypacific.us, or paul@chasenmgmt.com, or gina@builders.com, or jimmyjack@buildershw.com, etc.

*Saturday 1:45pm*
Sharing of calendars is enabled. To view your calendar go to <a href="http://calendar.jmading.com">http://calendar.jmading.com</a>. You should also be able to view example items I've placed on my calendar for today, tomorrow, and wednesday once Google apps finishes enabling the calendar.

*Saturday 1:30pm*
I've uploaded the jmading logo. It is currently seen when going to mail.jmading.com, but it does not look like Google has it working on the mail just yet. This will probably take about an hour before it is viewable on mail, calendar, and documents at the top left.

*Saturday 1:20pm*

Blackberry Google Apps IMAP setup instructions. <a href="http://blackberrystorm.wikidot.com/set-up-gmail-imap">Click here for the instructions.</a>

_Optionally_, there is also an eaiser to setup mobile app built by Google for blackberries. Here it is. <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/blackberry/">Link</a>. It will be easier to get working, but the IMAP solution above is a better setup.

*Saturday 10:47am*
You should each change your password. To change your password:
# Login to mail.jmading.com
# Make sure you are in your email
# Click 'Settings' at the top right part of your screen 
# On the settings screen click the 'Accounts' tab
# Click the 'Change Password' link (it's kinda small)
# Follow the onscreen instructions to change your password

*Saturday 2:10am*
Email is up! To access to go to <a href="http://mail.jmading.com">mail.jmading.com</a>.

* | username | password | email address | additional aliases | 
* | gina|passwordpassword | gina@jmading.com | gduarte@.. | 
* | james | passwordpassword | james@jmading.com | jj@.., jimmyjack@.., jimmy@.. |

as well all email address also can be used as .com or .net interchangeably. It will all go to the same place. Tomorrow, I will post/send instructions for setting up your outlooks, entourages, cell phones, etc to grab mail from the gmail imap system.


*Friday 5:45pm*

Paul's emails have completed the move over. Initiating 'nameserver' name change to the new host for the website ns1.slicehost.net and ns2.slicehost.net. This is reversible if something goes wrong. Changes take anywhere from 30minuts to 24 hours to complete (it is possible to even take 48 hours but very rare). Following completion email will be available at <a href="http://mail.jmading.com">mail.jmading.com</a>

*Friday 1:05pm*
* Paul. 200 mails fetched. View history  484 mails remaining. 

Once the rest of these emails get fixed I can make the nameserver changes. Then our emails will all be on Google apps. Then we can go about configuring our mobile devices.

*Friday 12:15pm*

* Paul. 199 emails fetched 884 remaining

*Friday 12pm*
	
* Holly. email is checked into new gmail box
* Gina. email is checked in. Most of Gina's historical emails lie in Goldmine though.
* James. much of .com email lies in Goldmine. .net email is checked in.
* Carol. emails is checked in. Most of Carol's historical email lies in Goldmine though.
* Paul's. Checking in the .com emails. .net email is checked in.

Once Paul's emails finish checking in I will review again and begin the nameserver change.
