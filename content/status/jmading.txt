Paul's emails have completed the move over. Initiating 'nameserver' name change to the new host for the website ns1.slicehost.net and ns2.slicehost.net. This is reversible if something goes wrong. Changes take anywhere from 30minuts to 24 hours to complete (it is possible to even take 48 hours but very rare). Following completion email will be available at <a href="http://mail.jmading.com">mail.jmading.com</a>

*Friday 1:05pm*
* Paul. 200 mails fetched. View history  484 mails remaining. 

Once the rest of these emails get fixed I can make the nameserver changes. Then our emails will all be on Google apps. Then we can go about configuring our mobile devices.

*Friday 12:15pm*

* Paul. 199 emails fetched 884 remaining

*Friday 12pm*
	
* Holly. email is checked into new gmail box
* Gina. email is checked in. Most of Gina's historical emails lie in Goldmine though.
* James. much of .com email lies in Goldmine. .net email is checked in.
* Carol. emails is checked in. Most of Carol's historical email lies in Goldmine though.
* Paul's. Checking in the .com emails. .net email is checked in.

Once Paul's emails finish checking in I will review again and begin the nameserver change.
