	<p>HRAssist provides affordable Human Resources services, and we programmed their site while <a href="http://collectiveindustry.com">Justin Pardee</a> did the design.</p>
	
	<p>The website is built with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> and is a good example of pragmatic design. HRAssist is a startup company with a limited budget. In turn, to start, we built a basic five page website and used freely available technologies like Paypal and HR Support Center where possible. In the future, HRAssist plans to build out their own custom payment processing and web based support application on top of the basic site, and with the framework already in place - Ruby on Rails - this will be much easier to do.</p>
