	<p>Twinstang is a web application for pilots to digitally log and track their flight hours. It is built with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> and also works on the iPhone.</p>
	
	<p>Twinstang is Spitfire Sky's first successful web application built in our spare time and on our own dollar. <strong>Over 1,000 flights have been entered by approximately 100 users</strong> and another 30 users (as of Jan 01, 2009) are in line for their invitation to the beta. <a href="http://twinstang.com">Sign up for the beta</a>.</p>
	
	<p><a href="http://scottmotte.com">Scott Motte</a>, a private pilot, developed the idea and continues to work on new features.</p>
