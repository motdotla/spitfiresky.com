	<p>The Southern Hotel is the JEM Foundation's first museum. It documents the history of the historic Perris Southern Hotel and the Bernasconi family that built it.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Spitfire Sky was tasked with creation of the website and the 30 foot timeline.</strong> The website is written in Ruby and was built using Merb. The timeline was created in Photoshop, printed on industrial-sized printers, and mounted on the wall.</p>
