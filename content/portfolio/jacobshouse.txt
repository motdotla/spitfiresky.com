	<p>Jacobs House is a local charity that functions a lot like Ronald McDonald House Charities, and we were hired to create their online identity.</p>
	
	<p>The site was custom designed as a theme on top of <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>. This allows the charity to easily keep the content up to date - even embedding video - as needed, when needed.</p>
