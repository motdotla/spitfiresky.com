	<p><em>Update:</em> We converted DarylBusch.com into a basic one page website at Daryl's request. He no longer wished to maintain the content of his large website.</p>
	
	<p>Daryl Busch is the Mayor of Perris. Spitfire Sky was in charge of his online identity to help him win his election. We also programmed a <strong>content management system using <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a></strong> into the site so that the mayor could easily update the content.</p>
