	<p>The application is built <strong>using <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a></strong>, <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)">AJAX</a> effects, a mid-level complex database to store the data using <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>, and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> to store the attachments and other files.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Everything is securely password protected and the passwords are encrypted.</li>
		<li>Clients are able to view the progress on their projects and create comments. Employees are able to do the same plus limit who sees the comment.</li>
		<li>Comments can include multiple attachments.</li>
		<li><strong>Users can be 'watching a project'.</strong> By watching a project, they receive email notices of any new comments, including any associated attachments.</li>
		<li><strong>The application is email-friendly</strong>. Employees and clients can create new comments with attachments by simply emailing the application.</li>
		<li><strong>For just 10cents/mo</strong>, all the attachments are stored using <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>. This drastically cuts potential server costs.</li>
