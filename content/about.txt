	<h1>A Web Software Company</h1>

	<p><strong>Spitfire Sky designs and develops simple, intuitive applications and websites to help companies succeed. <em>We do so successfully using agile development methods.</em></strong> Our work ranges from basic one page websites built with plain HTML to large Ruby on Rails applications utilizing the latest web services and hosted in the cloud.</p>

	<h2>Our Development Method</h2>

	<p><strong>We subscribe to the agile method of software development.</strong> We work in small blocks of time (2 weeks or so) called iterations where we identify a set of features, implement them, get customer feedback, and release full versions to the user community as often as practical.</p>

	<p>Essentially, we try and deliver real results as quickly as possible one feature at a time. But why employ this agile method instead of a more structured planning method? In our experience, for two major reasons (and many smaller ones).</p>

	<p>First, technology and competitors move fast on the web. It is important to move with them.</p>

	<p>Second, what a customer originally wants and what a customer comes to want differ, significantly. It is important we build what they come to want. This will lead the customer to success.</p>

	
	<p><strong>In turn we have come to value:</strong></p>
	<blockquote>
		<ul class="no-margin-left">
			<li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
			<li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
			<li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
			<li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="no-margin">That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.</p>
	</blockquote>
	

	

	<h2>Technologies We Employ</h2>

	<h3>Spitfire Sky utilizes the following technologies to build your website or web application.</h3>

	<p><em>Static HTML &amp; CSS</em> - We use old fashioned static HTML &amp; CSS for basic websites where the content will rarely change. DarylBusch.com is an example of a static HTML &amp; CSS site. Static HTML &amp; CSS is the most affordable way to jump start an online presence.</p>

	<p><em>WordPress</em> - We install WordPress on websites where the ability to manage the content is important to the customer. WordPress is a content management system that sets itself apart from the hundreds of others with its ease of use, full feature set, extensibility via plugins, and configurability. HemetFlightCenter.com is an example of a wordpress site. WordPress is a cost-effective and powerful way to manage your custom website.</p>

	<p><em>Ruby on Rails</em> - We use Ruby on Rails to build quality, high performance websites and web applications. Ruby on Rails is a web framework optimized for programmer happiness, productivity, and sustainability. It allows us to build unique web applications with an express purpose. Twinstang is built with Ruby on Rails. <strong>If you have a need to build a web application then Ruby on Rails is a good way to go.</strong></p>

	<p><em>Merb</em> - We employ Merb increasingly more often. Merb is a web framework like Ruby on Rails. In fact, it borrows a great deal from Rails and improves on it. It is faster, thread safe from the ground up, agnostic where important, includes MVC for mailers and slices, has a powerful router, and focuses on gems instead of plugins. Currently, we use Merb for applications that require more customization, more speed, and/or need to be easier to maintain than Ruby on Rails can provide. As Merb grows up, it very well might replace our use of Ruby on Rails.</p>


	<h3>Spitfire Sky utilizes the following important technologies internally and throughout the development process.</h3>

	<p><em>Git</em> - We use Git to version our code. Git is a distributed version control system focused on speed, effectivity and real-world usability on large projects. It keeps a timeline of the history of changes to the code of your website or web application.</p>

	<p><em>RSpec</em> - We use rspec to test our code. This helps us avoid bugs and squash bugs sooner when they do appear.</p>

	<p><em>Web Servers</em> - We use Slicehost servers for customers' websites and our own websites. <strong>The cost to the customer is generally $12 per month. We maintain the server and employ daily automated backups on the servers.</strong></p>

	<p><em>Code Server</em> - We own a server dedicated to storing the versioned code of our customers' websites and web applications.</p>

	<p><em>Design software</em> - We make use of various design software. We are skilled in Photoshop, Illustrator, Fireworks, Omnigraffle, Pen, Pencil, and Paper.</p>


	<h3>Spitfire Sky is also skilled in the following behind-the-scenes technologies:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Amazon S3 storage</li>
		<li>jQuery</li>
		<li>AJAX techniques</li>
		<li>Plain Ruby</li>
		<li>Plain PHP</li>
		<li>Apache</li>
		<li>Nginx</li>
		<li>Passenger/Mod_Rails</li>
		<li>Mongrel/Thin</li>
		<li>Ubuntu Linux</li>
		<li>Capistrano</li>
	</ul>
