	<h1>A Web Software Company</h1>

	<p><strong>Spitfire Sky designs and develops simple, intuitive applications and websites to help companies succeed. <em>We do so successfully using agile development methods.</em></strong> Our work ranges from basic one page websites built with plain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> to large <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> applications utilizing the latest web services and hosted in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">cloud</a>.</p>

	<h2>Our Development Method</h2>

	<p><strong>We subscribe to the agile method of software development.</strong> We work in small blocks of time (2 weeks or so) called iterations where we identify a set of features, implement them, get customer feedback, and release full versions to the user community as often as practical.</p>

	<p>Essentially, we try and deliver real results as quickly as possible one feature at a time. But why employ this agile method instead of a more structured planning method? In our experience, for two major reasons (and many smaller ones).</p>

	<p>First, technology and competitors move fast on the web. It is important to move with them.</p>

	<p>Second, what a customer originally wants and what a customer comes to want differ, significantly. It is important we build what they come to want. This will lead the customer to success.</p>

	
	<p><strong>In turn we have come to value:</strong></p>
	<blockquote>
		<ul class="no-margin-left">
			<li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
			<li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
			<li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
			<li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="no-margin">That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.</p>
		<p class="no-margin" align="right"><small>This is from the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org">Agile Manifesto</a> which we have <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/sign/display.cgi?ms=000000134">signed</a>.</small></p>
	</blockquote>
	

	

	<h2>Technologies We Employ</h2>

	<h3>Spitfire Sky utilizes the following technologies to build your website or web application.</h3>

	<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> &amp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a></em> - HTML and CSS are the core technologies of the web design world. We employ them on every website we build, but some websites require only these technologies in what we term a 'static' format. DarylBusch.com is an example of a static HTML &amp; CSS site. The content rarely needs updating so there is no need for a content management system. Static HTML &amp; CSS is the most affordable way to jump start your online presence.</p>

	<p><em><a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a></em> - We install Wordpress on websites where the ability to manage the content is important to the customer. Wordpress is a content management system that sets itself apart from the hundreds of others with its ease of use, full feature set, extensibility via plugins, and configurability. HemetFlightCenter.com is an example of a Wordpress site. Wordpress is a cost-effective and powerful way to manage your custom website.</p>

	<p><em><a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a></em> - We use Ruby on Rails to build quality, high performance websites and web applications. Ruby on Rails is a web framework optimized for programmer happiness, productivity, and sustainability. It allows us to build unique web applications with an express purpose. Twinstang is built with Ruby on Rails. <strong>If you have a need to build a web application then Ruby on Rails is a good way to go.</strong></p>

	<p><em><a href="http://merbivore.com/">Merb</a></em> - We employ Merb increasingly more often. Merb is a web framework like Ruby on Rails. In fact, it borrows a great deal from Rails and improves on it. It is faster, thread safe from the ground up, agnostic where important, includes MVC for mailers and slices, has a powerful router, and focuses on gems instead of plugins. Currently, we use Merb for applications that require more customization, more speed, and/or need to be easier to maintain than Ruby on Rails can provide. As Merb grows up, it very well might replace our use of Ruby on Rails.</p>


	<h3>Spitfire Sky utilizes the following important technologies internally and throughout the development process.</h3>

	<p><em><a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a></em> - We use Git to version our code. Git is a distributed version control system focused on speed, effectivity and real-world usability on large projects. It keeps a timeline of the history of changes to the code of your website or web application.</p>

	<p><em><a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a></em> - We use rspec to test our code. This helps us avoid bugs and squash bugs sooner when they do appear.</p>

	<p><em>Web Servers</em> - We use <a href="http://www.slicehost.com/">Slicehost</a> servers for customers' websites and our own websites. <strong>The cost to the customer is generally $12 per month. We maintain the server and employ daily automated backups on the servers.</strong></p>

	<p><em>Code Server</em> - We own a server dedicated to storing the versioned code of our customers' websites and web applications.</p>

	<p><em>Design software</em> - We make use of various design software. We are skilled in Photoshop, Illustrator, Fireworks, Omnigraffle, pen, pencil, and paper.</p>
