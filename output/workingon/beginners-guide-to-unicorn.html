        <h2>Beginner's guide to Unicorn</h2>
        <p>Ahoy. Thar' be unicorns. Here I show you how to get started using unicorn with nginx.</p>
        <h3>First things first</h3>
        <p>Unicorn is a nice replacement for mongrel and thin, and a good alternative to phusion passenger. GitHub <a href="http://github.com/blog/517-unicorn">uses unicorn</a>. I am assuming your server setup is similar to <a href="http://spitfiresky.com/blog/my-server-setup.html">my server setup</a>.</p>
        <h3>Installation</h3>
        <p>
          Install the unicorn gem.
        </p>
        <p>
          <script src="http://gist.github.com/223873.js"></script>
        </p>
        <p>
          Configure your nginx virtual host. It should look something like this. Take care to make sure the paths match correctly with where you are storing your application on the server.
        </p>
        <p>
          <script src="http://gist.github.com/223876.js"></script>
        </p>
        <p>
          In your merb or rails application create a config/unicorn.rb file. <small>(If you are deploying a rails app you would replace instances of RACK_ENV with RAILS_ENV.)</small>
        </p>
        <p>
          <script src="http://gist.github.com/223863.js"></script>
        </p>
        <p>
          Add a restart unicorn task to your deploy file.
        </p>
        <p>
          <script src="http://gist.github.com/223878.js"></script>
        </p>
        <p>
          Then deploy your app. With a little luck, you will be live.

        <p>Southern California. I was born here. I spent much of my early years swimming and building things with legos. That's still me today; torn between active living outside and mind numbing programming inside.</p>
        <p>From elementary to high school I spent my extracurricular time in athletics. Baseball was my favorite. I wanted one day to be a professional, but it wasn't to be. I had a good brain though so I went on to Pepperdine University to study international business.</p>
        <p>Freshman year in college I created my first website using the free 10mb of web space granted to each student - Pepperdine's greatest gift to me. Since then I've been forced to throw out much of what that school taught me about business, finding it ineffective, but that's for another post. It's 5 years later, and I'm mostly indoors now. Building things.</p>
        <h3>Spitfire Sky</h3>
        <p>I fly, and my favorite plane is the Spitfire. Couple it with 'Sky', and it becomes unique, memorable, google-able, and says something about who I am. It rolls off the tongue nicely too. Who is Spitfire Sky? Mostly it's just me, but increasingly I'm working with <a href="http://jeromegn.com">jeromegn</a> because he does exemplary work and makes me a better programmer.</p>
        <p>My hopes and plans for Spitfire Sky are to see it become recognized as a decent player in the field of other ruby developers/companies over the remainder of the year. During next year, I'd like to see Spitfire Sky recognized as a prominent player in that same field and see this blog become a source for quality information on some of the latest techniques and technologies related to web development.</p>
        <h3>In Ending (but lacking a conclusion)</h3>
        <p>What would I be doing if I was independently wealthy?</p>
        <p>I'd spend my mornings building web applications and my afternoons at the local general aviation airport.</p>
        <p>What is my greatest regret?</p>
        <p>I never hit a home run.</p>
