        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Good day. My name is Scott Motte. Here I introduce myself and my company.</p>
        <h3>Scott Motte</h3>
        <p>Southern California. I was born here. I spent much of my early years swimming and building things with legos. That's still me today; torn between flying airplanes and mind numbing programming inside.</p>
        <p>From elementary to high school I spent my extracurricular time in athletics. Baseball was my favorite. I wanted one day to be a professional, but it wasn't to be. I had a good brain though so I went on to Pepperdine University to study international business.</p>
        <p>Freshman year in college I created my first website using the free 10mb of web space granted to each student - Pepperdine's greatest gift to me. Since then I've been forced to throw out much of what that school taught me about business, finding it ineffective, but that's for another post. It's 5 years later, and I'm mostly indoors now. Building things.</p>
        <h3>Spitfire Sky</h3>
        <p>In January 2009 I rebranded my business to Spitfire Sky. Since then my skills have improved immensely. I've built and launched 3 noteworthy web applications - <a href="http://flossedtoday.com">Flossed Today</a>, <a href="http://missmint.com">Miss Mint</a>, and <a href="http://investapp.com">Investapp</a>. They haven't yet produced revenue, but one day they will.</p>
        <p>Spitfire Sky is not just me though. Since January 2009 I have worked closely with <a href="http://jeromegn.com">Jerome Gravel-Niquet of Canada</a>. He does exemplary design work and has made me a better programmer. The designs for Flossed Today and Investapp were completely his. Working together we have proven to be a good team and are sharing ownership on our next project - <a href="http://twinstang.com">Twinstang</a>. You should really <a href="/contact.html">hire us</a> for your next web application project.</p>
        <h3>Concluding</h3>
        <p>I'm a disciplined hard working fellow. I like to set goals, and I'm good at programming. For fun, I like to fly. If I was independently wealthy, I'd spend my mornings building web applications and my afternoons flying airplanes. My greatest regret is that I never hit a home run all my years in baseball. Inside the park homeruns, yes, many, but never over the fence.</p>
