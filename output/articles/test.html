        <h2>Test</h2>
        <p>Good day. My name is Scott Motte. Here I introduce myself and my company.</p>
        <h3>Scott Motte</h3>
        <p>Southern California. I was born here. I spent much of my early years swimming and building things with legos. That's still me today; torn between active living outside and mind numbing programming inside.</p>
        <p>From elementary to high school I spent my extracurricular time in athletics. Baseball was my favorite. I wanted one day to be a professional, but it wasn't to be. I had a good brain though so I went on to Pepperdine University to study international business.</p>
        <p>Freshman year in college I created my first website using the free 10mb of web space granted to each student - Pepperdine's greatest gift to me. Since then I've been forced to throw out much of what that school taught me about business, finding it ineffective, but that's for another post. It's 5 years later, and I'm mostly indoors now. Building things.</p>
        <h3>Spitfire Sky</h3>
        <p>I fly, and my favorite plane is the Spitfire. Couple it with 'Sky', and it becomes unique, memorable, google-able, and says something about who I am. It rolls off the tongue nicely too. Who is Spitfire Sky? Mostly it's just me, but increasingly I'm working with <a href="http://jeromegn.com">jeromegn</a> because he does exemplary work and makes me a better programmer.</p>
        <p>My hopes and plans for Spitfire Sky are to see it become recognized as a decent player in the field of other ruby developers/companies over the remainder of the year. During next year, I'd like to see Spitfire Sky recognized as a prominent player in that same field and see this blog become a source for quality information on some of the latest techniques and technologies related to web development.</p>
        <h3>In Ending (but lacking a conclusion)</h3>
        <p>What would I be doing if I was independently wealthy?</p>
        <p>I'd spend my mornings building web applications and my afternoons at the local general aviation airport.</p>
        <p>What is my greatest regret?</p>
        <p>I never hit a home run.</p>
